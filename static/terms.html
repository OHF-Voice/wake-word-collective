    <h1>Open Home Foundation Wake Word Collective Legal Terms</h1>
    <i>Effective July 15, 2024</i>

    <p>
      Through Wake Word Collective, you can donate your voice to build an
      open-source voice database that anyone can use to make innovative voice
      recognition apps for devices and the web.
    </p>
    <p>
      By contributing to Wake Word Collective, you hereby agree to be bound by
      the Terms set forth below. The mere contribution implies the knowledge and
      acceptance of these Terms. In some cases, we can also ask you to
      explicitly agree.
    </p>
    <h2>1. Eligibility</h2>
    <p>
      Wake Word Collective is open to anyone over the age of 19. If you are 19
      years of age or younger, you must have your parent or guardian’s consent
      and they must supervise your participation in Wake Word Collective.
    </p>
    <p>
      Open Home Foundation has the right to exclude your participation at any
      time without giving a reason.
    </p>
    <h2>2. Your Contributions</h2>
    <p>
      The database of Open Home Foundation’s Wake Word Collective will be made
      available under the Creative Commons CC0 public domain dedication (CC0).
      That means it’s public and we’ve waived all copyrights to the extent we
      can under the law. If you participate in Wake Word Collective, we require
      that you do the same. You must agree that Open Home Foundation may offer
      all of your contributions to the public under the CC0 public domain
      dedication.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, by participating to Wake Word Collective, you also make the
      following two warranties:
    </p>
    <p>First, that your contributions are entirely your own creation.</p>
    <p>
      Second, that your contributions do not infringe on any third parties’
      rights.
    </p>
    <p>
      You agree to indemnify, defend and hold Open Home Foundation harmless,
      from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses and
      expenses related to or arising out of your breach of the two
      aforementioned warranties.
    </p>
    <h2>3. Data Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      "Personal information" means information which either directly identifies
      you or can be reasonably linked or combined to identify you. Any
      information that falls outside of this is "non-personal information."
    </p>
    <p>
      If we store your personal information with information that is
      non-personal, we will consider the combination as personal information. If
      we remove all personal information from a set of data then the remaining
      is non-personal information.
    </p>
    <p>
      You acknowledge that as a result of your participation in Wake Word
      Collective, personal information that you provide to us directly or
      indirectly or that is automatically collected through the exchange of
      information between the systems involved may be processed.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you give us information, we will use it in the ways for which you've
      given us permission. Generally, we use your information to help us provide
      and improve our products and services for you. As soon as the personal
      information, provided to us under these Terms, has fulfilled its purpose,
      we will no longer process it and will delete it.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are committed to protecting your personal information once we have it.
      We implement physical, business and technical security measures.
    </p>
    <p>
      You acknowledge and hereby expressly authorize that the personal
      information provided in the context of your participation in Wake Word
      Collective may be made available to third parties and processed by them,
      in particular via CC0.
    </p>
    <h2>4. Disclaimers</h2>
    <p>
      By participating in Wake Word Collective, you agree that Open Home
      Foundation will not be liable in any way for any inability to use Wake
      Word Collective or for any claim arising out of these terms. Open Home

      incidental, consequential, or exemplary damages direct or indirect damages
      for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, lost profits, loss of data, or

    </p>
    <p>
      Any liability arising out of or in connection with these Terms is hereby
      expressly excluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      You agree to indemnify and hold Open Home Foundation harmless from and
      against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses and expenses
      related to or arising out of your contribution to Wake Word Collective.
    </p>
    <p>
