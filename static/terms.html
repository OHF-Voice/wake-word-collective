  <h1>Open Home Foundation Wake Word Collective Legal Terms</h1>
  <i>Effective June 21, 2024</i>

  <p>
    Through Wake Word Collective, you can donate your voice to build an
    open-source voice database that anyone can use to make innovative voice
    recognition apps for devices and the web.
  </p>
  <p>
    You may only participate in Wake Word Collective if you agree to these
    Terms.
  </p>
  <h2>1. Eligibility</h2>
  <p>
    Wake Word Collective is open to anyone over the age of 19. If you are 19 or
    under, you must have your parent or guardian’s consent and they must
    supervise your participation in Wake Word Collective.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Your Contributions</h2>
  <p>
    We make Open Home Foundation’s Wake Word Collective database available under
    the Creative Commons CC0 public domain dedication. That means it’s public
    and we’ve waived all copyrights to the extent we can under the law. If you
    participate in Common voice, we require that you do the same. You must agree
    that Open Home Foundation may offer all of your Contributions (including
    text, recordings, validations, and feedback) to the public under the CC0
    public domain dedication.

  <p>
    In order to participate in Wake Word Collective, Open Home Foundation also
    requires that you make two assurances:
  </p>
  <p>First, that your Contributions are entirely your own creation.</p>
  <p>
    Second, that your Contributions do not infringe on any third parties’
    rights.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you cannot make these assurances, you may not participate in Common
    Voice.
  </p>
  <h2>3. Disclaimers</h2>
  <p>
    By participating in Wake Word Collective, you agree that Open Home
    Foundation will not be liable in any way for any inability to use Wake Word
    Collective or for any claim arising out of these terms. Open Home Foundation
    specifically disclaims the following: Indirect, special, incidental,
    consequential, or exemplary damages Direct or indirect damages for loss of
    goodwill, work stoppage, lost profits, loss of data, or computer malfunction
  </p>

  <p>
    You agree to indemnify and hold Open Home Foundation harmless for any
    liability or claim that comes results from your participation in Wake Word
    Collective.
  </p>
  <p>
    Open Home Foundation provides the service “as is.” Open Home Foundation
    specifically disclaims any legal guarantees or warranties such as
    “merchantability,” “fitness for a particular purpose,” “non-infringement,”
    and warranties arising out of a course of dealing, usage or trade.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Notices of Infringement</h2>
  <p>
    If you think something in Wake Word Collective infringes your copyright or
    trademark rights, please see our policy for how to report infringement.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Updates</h2>
  <p>
    Every once in a while, Open Home Foundation may decide to update these
    Terms. We will post the updated Terms online.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you continue to use Wake Word Collective after we post updated Terms, you
    agree to accept that this constitutes your acceptance of such changes. We
    will post an effective date at the top of this page to make it clear when we
    made our most recent update.
